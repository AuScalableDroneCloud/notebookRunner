change to the notebook folder

start the jupyter server

jupyter notebook

depending on jupyter version you can also add --no_browser as a parameter

python runNotebook.py

note:

You need to add the Jupyter token into the start of the python code - currently the code is using "<generated>" as the token, as I set Jupyter to use this fixed token.
  
I'll update this document as to how to do this, once I remember (check my notes)...
