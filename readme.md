change to the notebook folder

start the jupyter server

jupyter notebook

python runNotebook.py

note:

Uou need to add the Jupyter token into the start of the python code - currently the code is using "<generated>" as the token, as I set Jupyter to use this fixed token
  
I'll update this document as to how to do this, once I remember (check my notes)...
